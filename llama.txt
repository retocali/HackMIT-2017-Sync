There once was a llama named Chris. This llama was taken care of
by a little bitch named Wei, given to him by the government man,
Joey, after his 43rd birthday. The llama was the pride of the 
herd for poor old Wei, and everyday Wei watched with tears in 
his eyes, Chris walking about spit everywhere the sun hit.
