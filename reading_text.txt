I had an amazing experience on the northern shore of Kauai today. We swam
with Pacific Green Sea Turtles. They are called honu in Hawaii and are a symbol
of knowledge and long life. A special guide took us to the protective reefs where
the turtles spend time. Under her guidance, we learned how to use the
snorkeling equipment that allowed us to be underwater and breathe air from
above through a tube. But snorkeling wasn't all she knew about! She was a
marine biologist, so she knew all about the creatures of the ocean. She led us
safely through our adventure and told us many interesting things about what
we saw. When I saw the first turtle, my heart was pounding. I was so excited! We
were not allowed to touch them, but it was enough just to be near these gentle
and graceful creatures. We swam among thousands of colorful fish, and we saw
octopuses and eels. What a special day!
